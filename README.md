# C-.Net-Drawing
This is a C# windowed program that allows the choice of two people to play
Tic Tac Toe, or allows a single user to play against the computer.

When the program starts, a playing area is displayed. Each player is able to
click in an area and the program will draw an X or O as appropriate.
